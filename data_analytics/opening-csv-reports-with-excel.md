# Opening CSV reports with Excel

Reports downloaded from the Instructor Dashboard are by default in CSV format.&#x20;

_\*It is not possible to download the report in any other format than CSV._&#x20;

CSV is a standard file known as "comma separated values" â€‹. Once you have downloaded your CSV file, you can ready it using Apple Notes, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets or another suitable CSV file reader.&#x20;

Unfortunately Microsoft does not automatically convert .CSV files into .XLSX, and you must use their **Import Text Wizard**. This is also outlined and explained in more depth on the Microsoft website here ([reference URL](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-5250ac4c-663c-47ce-937b-339e391393ba))

# Studio vs LMS

There are 2 parts to MOOCit:&#x20;

* **The LMS** - the 'front-end', or learner interface. This is where your learners will connect and follow the course.&#x20;

The access to create / modify the course is done within MOOCit Studio, the LMS is the **yourbusinessname.moocit.fr** link which is the learner access point.

You can also access the LMS by opening your course in Studio and selecting 'View Live'.&#x20;

# Advanced Components

By default, when you create a new course advanced components are not yet activated. When you go to the Unit page, you will not see the option for 'Advanced'.&#x20;

To enable the Advanced Components option, follow these steps.

1. In Studio, select **Settings**, and then **Advanced Settings**.
2. Locate the **Advanced Module List** field. This field lists any exercises and tools that have been added to your course.
3.  If the **Advanced Module List** field is empty, place your cursor between the brackets (`[ ]`).

    If the list already contains one or more keys, place your cursor after the first bracket (`[`).
4. Enter the key for the exercise or tool that you want to add.
5.  Add quotation marks (`" "`) before and after the key.

    If you are adding the key to a list of keys, follow the closing quotation mark with a comma character (`,`).
6. Select to 'Save' your changes.&#x20;
7. Review your entry to verify that the key is accurate and that it is surrounded by quotation marks. If there is a list of keys, they must be comma separated.

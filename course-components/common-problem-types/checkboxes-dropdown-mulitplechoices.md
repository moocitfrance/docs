_These question types are also available with_ [_Hints + Feedback (see tutorial)_](hints-and-feedback.md)_._&#x20;

### Checkboxes

Checkboxes are a multiple choice question with more than one correct answer. To create a checkbox question, write each possible answer on a separate line using square brackets before each option (`[ ]`). \
`[x]` indicates a correct answer\
`[ ]` indicates an incorrect answer

{% hint style="info" %}
You can add as many or as little `'[x]`_`answers`_' as you want!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Dropdown

Dropdown question is a droppable menu with 2 or more possible answers and the learner can select only one.\
To create a dropdown question:\
\- Start with 2 opening square brackets  (`[[` ) \
\- Add each possible answer on a separate line \
\- Indicate the correct answer using regular brackets (`()`).\
\- End with 2 closing square brackets (`]]` ).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can add as many `or= options acceptable variant(s)` as you want!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Numerical Input

For a numerical input question, enter ' `=` ' with the numerical answer directly after. If you wish, you can add an approximate answer by adding plus / minus and number or percentage. To do this, add  '`+-`' directly after the answer, followed by a number or percentage.&#x20;

For example, for the following question, any numerical answer between 95 - 100 would be considered as correct:&#x20;

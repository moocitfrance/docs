## Question title, prompt, header and text

Your questions may include several levels of text which will be visible to learners: Title, header, question text, question prompt, and question tip. Only 2 of these are required: \
\
**Question Title** is the title of the component and is a required field.\
**Question prompt** is also a required field.&#x20;

This is how a question looks in learner view with all of the text fields:&#x20;

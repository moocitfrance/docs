7\) Modify the image dimensions by changing the height / width (pixels). As long as you keep '**Lock Proportions**' selected, the image dimensions will remain the same. Once you're done select '**Insert Image**'.&#x20;

8\) To modify the image size once it has been inserted. Highlight the image (the same way that you would highlight text). Use the dots in the corners and sides of the image to drag & drop the size to your preference.&#x20;

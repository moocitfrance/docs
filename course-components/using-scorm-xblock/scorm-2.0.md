## Step one: add the SCORM module to your course.&#x20;

From **Studio Home**, open the desired course. In **Settings** > **Advanced settings** > **List of advanced modules add** `"scorm"`

Select to save your changes.&#x20;

## Step two: add a SCORM component to the unit page.&#x20;

Next, open the unit where you want to add your SCORM file. Select to **add a new component** > **Advanced** > **SCORM Module**

Save your changes.&#x20;

## Step 4: Publish and view in LMS.&#x20;

When you save the changes you will probably see a 404 message. Don't worry, the backend (Studio) is not suitable for displaying SCORM files.&#x20;

Instead, choose to "**Publish**" your changes. Then select “**View Live**”. From here you can view and test your SCORM in the LMS (Learner View).

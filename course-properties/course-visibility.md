# Manage Course Visibility

The course catalogue is available on the \<yoursite>/courses page. It presents the courses that are open for registration. Invitation only courses are not visible on this page.&#x20;

### Display a Course in the Course Catalogue&#x20;

For a course to appear in the catalog, the enrollment for the course must be active, therefor the start date for the course must be earlier than today's date:

1. Connect to Studio and select the desired course&#x20;
2. In the header menu select _**Settings > Schedule & Details**_
3. Fill in _**'Enrollment Start Date'**_  (in the past)&#x20;
4. Save changes&#x20;

The course is now visible in the catalog and registrations are open.

### Hide a Course in the Catalogue

To hide a course in the catalog, delete the start date for registrations or add an end date for registrations earlier than today's date:&#x20;

1. Connect to Studio and select the course you wish to hide&#x20;
2. Select the menu _**Settings / Schedule & Details**_
3. Fill in _**'Enrollment End Date'**_ (in the past) OR simply leave the _**'Enrollment Start Date'**_  blank
4. Save changes&#x20;

The course is now hidden in the catalogue.&#x20;

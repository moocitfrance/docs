You must make a demand to have any course permanently deleted.&#x20;

In order to do so, send an email to support@moocit.fr, including the following details:&#x20;

* Course Title
* Organisation Name&#x20;

You can access this information on Studio Home.&#x20;

You may also simply send us a screen shot of the course details from Studio Home indicating the information, as below:&#x20;

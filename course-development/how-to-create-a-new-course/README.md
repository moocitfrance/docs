In order to create courses in MOOCit Studio, you must be on a [**Business** or **Pro** plan](https://en.moocit.fr/tarifs) and have Course Creator status.&#x20;

To help keep your courses organized, we recommend having a maximum of 1-2 users with Course Creator Status. Once a new course is created, the creator can invite users to develop course as course team members. To better understand the roles of team members in the course development, refer to the [Course Team Members](../../instructors/adding-course-team-members/) document.&#x20;

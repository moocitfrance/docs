## Course Title: Best Practices

When you determine the title of your course, consider the following guidelines.

* Use title capitalization and normal spacing and punctuation.
* Limit the course name to 70 characters. Many of the most effective course titles have 50 or fewer characters.
* If the course is part of a sequence, create a title that includes both sequence and course information, formatted as “Sequence: Course”.
* Select a course title that clearly indicates the course subject matter.
* Make sure the course title follows search engine optimization (SEO) guidelines.
* Make sure the course title targets a global audience.

### Course Title Examples (Open edX)&#x20;

The following course titles are for stand-alone courses.

* English Grammar and Essay Writing
* Front-End Web Developing
* The Science of Happiness

The following course titles are for courses in a sequence or in a program such as an XSeries.

* Circuits and Electronics 1: Basic Circuit Analysis
* Circuits and Electronics 2: Amplification, Speed, and Delay
* Circuits and Electronics 3: Applications

## Course Organization Name&#x20;

It is important to use the same **Organization** name every time, as this is a part of the URL which links to your customized LMS (logo, fonts, colours, etc). If you do not use the correct Organization name, you course will appear in the _MOOCit General LMS_.  For questions or concerns about the Organization name, please contact support@moocit.fr

## Course Number and Run Best Practices&#x20;

Course numbers have the following guidelines.

* Course numbers can have a maximum of 10 characters.
* Characters can be letters, numbers, or periods.
* If a course consists of several modules, the course number can have an ending such as .1x or .2x.

Best Practices:&#x20;

* Create a formula to keep your course number and run organized.&#x20;
* Use '1' for **Course Run** for the first time a course is delivered, and augment by 1 each time the course is reran.&#x20;

# Course Structure

## Course Structure

All courses are structured into _Sections_, _Subsections_ and _Units_. Each unit represents one page in the course. On every unit you can add multiple components (questions, text, html, video, etc.). &#x20;

Course authors build out the structure of the course on the **Course Outline** page in **Studio**. Learners see this course outline in the **LMS**.

To view the course outline in the LMS, go to the **Course Outline** page in Studio, and then select either **Preview** or **View Live**.

In the following image, the Studio view of the course outline is on the left. On the right is the view of the course outline in the LMS.

To view the course outline, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to **MOOCit Studio**&#x20;
2.  On the **My Courses** page, select the course you want to develop.

    The course outline opens by default when you open a course.

To open the outline when you are working in a course, from the **Content** menu, select **Outline**.

The first time you view an outline for a course, it contains no content. The following message is visible:&#x20;

# Hide a Subsection after Due Date

You can make a subsection’s content unavailable based on date. For example, you might want to make exam questions unavailable after a certain date. For instructor-led courses, this option uses the subsection’s due date. For self- paced courses, this option uses the course’s end date.

Subsections that are hidden in this way remain visible in the course navigation, and are included when grades are calculated. However, learners can no longer access the subsection’s content after the due date or the course end date.

To hide a subsection based on date, follow these steps.

1.  Select the **Configure** icon in the subsection box.

    The subsection settings dialog box opens.
2. On the **Visibility** tab, locate **Subsection Visibility**, and then select the appropriate option.
   * In instructor-led courses, select **Hide content after due date**.
   * In self-paced courses, select **Hide content after course end date**.
3. Select **Save**.

Learners who access the subsection after the due date or course end date has passed are shown a message indicating that the subsection is no longer available because the due date (or course end date) has passed.

In the course outline in Studio, the subsection is shown with an icon and a “Subsection is hidden after due date” or “Subsection is hidden after course end date” message under the subsection’s display name.\

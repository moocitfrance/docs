### Course About Video Guidelines

The course About video should excite and entice potential learners to enroll, and reveal some of the personality that the course team brings to the course.

This video should answer these key questions.

* Who is teaching the course?
* What university or institution is the course affiliated with?
* What topics and concepts are covered in your course?
* Why should a learner enroll in your course?

This video should deliver your message as concisely as possible and have a run time of less than two minutes.

* Upload your course about video to YouTube.&#x20;
* When the file is uploaded, open the video link.&#x20;

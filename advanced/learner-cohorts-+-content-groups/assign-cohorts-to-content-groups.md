# Assign Cohorts to Content Groups

After you create a content group, you can associate it with one or more cohorts with which you want to share the same special content.

{% hint style="info" %}
A content group can be associated with more than one cohort; a cohort cannot be associated with more than one content group.
{% endhint %}

To associate a cohort with a content group, follow these steps:

In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

Select the **Settings** tab for the selected cohort.

Under **Associated Content Group**, choose the **Select a Content Group** option.

From the content group drop down list, select the content group that you want your cohort to be associated with.

Select '**Save**'.&#x20;

## Viewing Cohort-Specific Course Content in Studio&#x20;

After you restrict access to units or components to particular content groups, you can view your course content as a member of a content group to ensure that members of each group correctly see the content intended for them.

To view the components or units that have been made available to learners in each of the content groups in your course, follow these steps.

1. In Studio, select **Settings**, then select **Group Configurations**.
2.  On the **Group Configurations** page, locate the content group for which you want to view the usage.

    The content groupâ€™s box displays the number of locations (units or components) that are designated for learners in cohorts associated with that content group.
3. Click the content group name to view the names of units and components that that are specified as available to learners in the group.
4. Click a linked location name to go to that unit in the course outline, where you can change the group access settings for the unit or component.

# Create Cohort Specific Content with Content Groups

## Create Content Groups&#x20;

We use content groups to designate specific course content as available to particular cohorts of learners. Content groups are created in Studio, follow the steps below to get started.&#x20;

In **Studio** select **Settings** > **Group Configurations**&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2020-12-18 at 10.50.04.png>)

On the **Group Configurations** page select '**+ Add your first content group**'&#x20;

Enter a meaningful name for the content group, then select '**Create'**. The page will refresh to show the name of your new content group.

Repeat this step to create as many content groups as you want.

## Specify Content as Available Only to Appropriate Content Groups&#x20;

After you create a content group, you can work with your course outline to specify which **components** and/or **units** are available to specific content groups.

You cannot specify entire subsections or sections for restricted access by particular content groups.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: If a unit has content group access restrictions set, all of the components in the unit inherit the restrictions - _unless_ you explicitly set different content group access restrictions for individual components.
{% endhint %}

## Assign a Unit to a Content Group&#x20;

To associate a particular Unit with a content group open the **Course Outline** in **Studio**.&#x20;

Select the wheel icon to '**Configure**' the desired unit.&#x20;

Select to _Restrict access to '**Content Groups**'._&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2020-12-21 at 19.31.16.png>)

Select the desired groups, and '**Save**'.&#x20;

## Assign a Component to a Content Group&#x20;

To associate a component with a content group open the **Unit** in **Studio** with the desired component.

Select to '**Access Settings**' for the component.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2020-12-21 at 19.34.33.png>)

Select to '_Restrict Access to **Content Groups**_', and select the desired group(s).&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2020-12-21 at 19.35.44.png>)

When you've made your selection hit '**Save**'.&#x20;

# Dividing Discussions by Cohort

By default, all course-wide discussion topics and content-specific discussion topics are unified: all learners can interact with all posts, responses, and comments. You can change discussion topics of either type to be divided or unified on the instructor dashboard in the LMS.

To specify the group type for dividing discussions, follow these steps.

From the **Instructor Dashboard** in the **LMS** select **Discussions.**&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The **Discussions** tab is available only if you have enabled cohorts or have multiple enrollment tracks in your course.
{% endhint %}

Under **Specify whether discussion topics are divided**, select the option to use for dividing discussion topics by cohorts.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2020-12-21 at 23.00.43.png>)

{% hint style="warning" %}
You only see options that are applicable for your course. For example, if cohorts are not enabled in your course, you do not have an option to divide discussions based on cohorts. If you do not have more than one enrollment track in your course, you do not have an option to divide discussions based on enrollment track.
{% endhint %}

Specify which discussion topics are divided by selecting them.&#x20;

Then selecting to **Save**.&#x20;

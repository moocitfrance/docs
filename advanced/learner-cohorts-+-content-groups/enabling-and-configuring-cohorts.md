## Add Cohorts

Select to '**+ Add Cohort**'&#x20;

Name your cohort (_Note: Cohort names are visible to learners_)

Specify whether learners are [_**automatically**_](./#automated-cohort-assignment) (randomly assigned) or [_**manually**_](./#manual-cohort-assignment) assigned (you add them) to the cohort

Associate a content group for the cohort ([_we will cover this later_](assign-cohorts-to-content-groups.md))&#x20;

Select to '**Save**'.&#x20;

### Assign Learners (Manual Cohort Assignment Method)&#x20;

In the **LMS** > **Instructor Dashboard** > **Cohorts**&#x20;

**Choose the cohort** you wish to add learners to.

You can either add learners by:

Option 1)  copy + pasting their email addresses, separated by new lines or commas. Then select to '**+ Add new learners**'.

Option 2) uploading a CSV file, by selecting '**Assign learners to cohorts by uploading a CSV file**'.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note**: Learners may only belong to 1 cohort. If a learner is already assigned to Cohort A, and you manually assign him to Cohort B, he will automatically be removed from Cohort A.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

# Learner Cohorts + Content Groups

### About Learner Cohorts

Divide your learners into smaller groups using the cohorts feature. With cohorts, you can give learners a course experience that is specific to the group that they belong to. Learner cohorts will enable you to:&#x20;

* Create divided discussion topics by cohort - so that learners only interact with other members of the same cohort.
* Deliver different variations of course content to learners based on the cohort they are assigned to.
* Offer different variations of assignments or exams based.&#x20;

Using cohorts is an optional feature. Learners can be assigned to cohorts either _**automatically**_ or _**manually**_.&#x20;

### Automated cohort assignment&#x20;

An automated cohort assignment will put learners at random in to the automated cohorts (groups). Automated assignment works well if, for example, you are creating cohorts simply to create small groups of learners. The cohorts that result from automated random assignment are likely to be more equal in size.

### Manual cohort assignment&#x20;

Manual cohort assignment means that you manually add the list of learners to the cohort. Any learner who is not manually added to a cohort before signing up to the course, will be assigned to a 'Default' automated cohort.&#x20;

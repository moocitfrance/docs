Here, learners can browse discussion topics, and find instructions on how to use the discussion forums.&#x20;

To create a new post inside a discussion, select 'Add a Post'. \
Select their post type, topic (discussion) area, title and type their question or idea.&#x20;

## Course Wide Discussions vs Content-Specific Discussions

There are 2 types of discussions you can create: course-wide discussions and content-specific discussions.&#x20;

**Course-Wide Discussions**\
Course-wide discussions are added in the advanced settings, and are only available in the ‘Discussion’ page of the LMS. By default, all courses include a page named Discussion with a course-wide discussion topic named “General”.&#x20;

Course-wide discussion topics are useful for offering administrative assistance, technical help, or other topics that are useful for learners throughout the duration of the course.

**Content-Specific Discussions**\
Content-specific discussions are created on the unit page using the discussion component. These discussions are available for learners on the Course Unit page where it is published, _and_ on the discussions page. Content-specific discussions are useful for discussing course topics at the moment learners are covering it.&#x20;

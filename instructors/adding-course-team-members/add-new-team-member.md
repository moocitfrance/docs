3. In Studio, select **Settings** > **Course Team**.&#x20;
4. Select **+ New Team Member**.&#x20;
5. Enter the new team member's email address

To preview the course in the LMS, the team member must register for the course.&#x20;

### How do I fix "Error Adding User"?&#x20;

If you see a notice saying 'Error adding user', it means that you do not have the right user email address, or the user has not yet created an account.

Before adding a user as a Course Team Member, they must first create a user (learner) account and activate that account. You must use the same user email address to add them to your course team.&#x20;

You can consult the history of emails sent at the bottom of the page.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are no control limits of the emails carried out, or of the number of emails received by registrants.
{% endhint %}

You can also send emails from your emailing tool (mailchimp, sendinblue, etc.) by downloading the learner list in csv format.

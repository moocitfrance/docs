# Set Your Platform Language

MOOCit LMS + Studio are currently available in English, French, Spanish and German.&#x20;

When learners connect for the first time, their language will automatically be in the language of your invitation.&#x20;

You can change the language from MOOCit Studio, or from the LMS.&#x20;

Learners can change their language settings from the LMS > Account Menu.&#x20;

## Change the Language from Studio&#x20;

From anywhere in **MOOCit Studio**, in the **header menu**, select the **drop down menu** to change the platform language.&#x20;

## What properties change when we change the language?&#x20;

By changing the platform language, all of the platform menu options, page titles, etc will appear in the new language. However, changing the language does not change the language of the content you create ie Course Title, Section, Subsection, Unit Titles, Component text, About page, etc.&#x20;

Here is an example of a course I created in English, and afterwards, I changed the platform to French. The green indicates my content (in English), red indicates MOOCit platform properties in  French.&#x20;
